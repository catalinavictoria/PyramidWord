# PyramidWord
 Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise for Software Engineering Intern
 
# Challenge
Write a web service that takes in a string and returns a boolean to indicate whether or not a word is a pyramid word. A word is a "pyramid word" if you can arrange the letters in increasing frequency, starting with 1 and continuing without gaps and without duplicates.

For example: banana is a pyramid word because you have 1 "b", 2 "n's", and 3 "a's". bandana is not a pyramid word because you have 1 "b" and 1 "d".

# Implementation
This project implements a web service using Python and Flask micro web framework.
